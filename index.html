                    Gene is the vocalist for Noise Pollution. Classically trained on piano, he switched to guitar around the time "For Those About to Rock" was released. Driving around with friends in high school, everyone sang along to songs from Boston to Def Leppard, but there was only one person in the car that could deliver the 'Brian Johnson' when AC/DC came on the radio. A few years back, he decided it was time to start an AC/DC band- "Guns for Hire" was born. Putting a band together is not an easy process- but he learned a lot about finding and auditioning musicians, booking venues and putting set lists together. Some recordings caught the ear of a popular New England tribute band, "Fat Angus", where he got the chance to sing for them. Assembling Noise Pollution was almost too easy- loads of talent and quite honestly the best group of musicians to spend time with- on and off the stage. Now the only thing left to say is... Are you ready?

                    Tony has been writing and performing music for over 30 years.  Primarily self taught on guitar, he has studied musical theory and learned to sing and/or play other instruments over the years as needed to get on stage.  As a lead guitar player in cover and original alternative metal bands in college, he learned to use, and sometimes build, a variety of musical equipment.  Now the lead guitarist and backup singer for Noise Pollution, he really enjoys performing AC/DC’s blues inspired, iconic hard rock hits in front of energetic audiences.  And while he’s never been able to fit in Angus’ school boy uniform, studying the lead guitarist’s trademark playing style and representing his legendary onstage presence is both a unique challenge and an amazing experience.

                    The Noise Pollution band is still trying to figure out this person named Oz.  One day, he simply showed up at their practice unannounced, plugged in his Gretsch guitar, and began playing Malcolm Young riffs.  It is not known how Oz found the band, but at the time, the band was in search of a rhythm guitarist.  The band has tried to research his background, but little could be found.  Past acquaintances suggest he spoke little and was frequently seen listening to his Walkman.  Supposedly, this began at a young age after receiving two tapes – Back in Black and Powerage – that were gifted to him from his Aunt Rosie’s estate.  Records show disciplinary issues while attending Catholic school, with repeated instances of Oz being caught sneaking into the church after hours to recite the sermon from Let There Be Rock.  Shortly after high school, he was reportedly dismissed from his job at the Dixie Boy Truck Stop because he insisted on continuously playing ACDC Live at high volumes over the sound system.   Soon after, he was rarely seen without a Gretsch in his hands.  There are other stories, such as Oz supposedly playing the Jailbreak riff for six hours straight, but as of this writing, this remains unconfirmed.  While much still remains unknown, what is known is that Oz is passionate about AC/DC music and has dedicated himself towards playing rhythm guitar in honor of Malcom Young.

                    A rocker, a roller, a right out of controller, Joe’s passion for music was re-awakened by pounding bass lines in the join a band program at Band Gig and playing cornet in the Dedham Community Band. Prior to joining Noise Pollution, he was the bassist for a local rock cover band, Side Hustle. In the Spring, he was the bassist in a trio of musicians performing the score to the Dedham Middle School production of The Sound of Music. Joe always tries like hell to be about to rock. On Memorial Day he salutes you, and our military, by playing taps on his bugle.
