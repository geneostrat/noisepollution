                    <h4 class="subtitle">Vocals</h4>
                    <p>
					Gene is the vocalist for Power Up. Classically trained on piano, he switched to guitar around the time "For Those About to Rock" was released. Although his vocals can cover artists from Tesla through Def Leppard.. it turns out his 'secret' super-power is being able to replicate the vocal stylings of 'Brian Johnson'. A few years back, he decided it was time to start an AC/DC band- "Guns for Hire" was born. Putting a band together is not an easy process- but he learned a lot about finding and auditioning musicians, booking venues and putting set lists together. Some recordings caught the ear of a popular New England tribute band, "Fat Angus", where he got the chance to sing for them. Assembling Power Up was almost too easy- see us soon.

                    <p>Mike is the drummer for Power Up. He is a student of the Phil Rudd drum technique. He has toured extensively with another band- but felt the need to scratch that AC/DC itch. He has seen AC/DC perform live more than another other member of Power Up and knows their song catalog inside and out. Mike also supports Power Up with professional sound and lighting.</p>

                    <h4 class="subtitle">Lead Guitar</h4>
                    <p>
					Tony has been writing and performing music for over 30 years.  Primarily self taught on guitar, he has studied musical theory and learned to sing and/or play other instruments over the years as needed to get on stage.  As a lead guitar player in cover and original alternative metal bands in college, he learned to use, and sometimes build, a variety of musical equipment.  Now the lead guitarist and backup singer for Power Up, he really enjoys performing AC/DC’s blues inspired, iconic hard rock hits in front of energetic audiences.  And while he’s never been able to fit in Angus’ school boy uniform, studying the lead guitarist’s trademark playing style and representing his legendary onstage presence is both a unique challenge and an amazing experience.

                    <h1 class="title">Oz</h1>
                    <h4 class="subtitle">Rhythm Guitar</h4>
                    <p>
					The Power Up band is still trying to figure out this person named Oz.  One day, he simply showed up at their practice unannounced, plugged in his Gretsch guitar, and began playing Malcolm Young riffs.  It is not known how Oz found the band, but at the time, the band was in search of a rhythm guitarist.  The band has tried to research his background, but little could be found.  Past acquaintances suggest he spoke little and was frequently seen listening to his Walkman.  Supposedly, this began at a young age after receiving two tapes – Back in Black and Powerage – that were gifted to him from his Aunt Rosie’s estate.  Records show disciplinary issues while attending Catholic school, with repeated instances of Oz being caught sneaking into the church after hours to recite the sermon from Let There Be Rock.  Shortly after high school, he was reportedly dismissed from his job at the Dixie Boy Truck Stop because he insisted on continuously playing ACDC Live at high volumes over the sound system.   Soon after, he was rarely seen without a Gretsch in his hands.  There are other stories, such as Oz supposedly playing the Jailbreak riff for six hours straight, but as of this writing, this remains unconfirmed.  While much still remains unknown, what is known is that Oz is passionate about AC/DC music and has dedicated himself towards playing rhythm guitar in honor of Malcom Young.

                    <h1 class="title">Rich</h1>
                    <h4 class="subtitle">Bass Guitar</h4>
                    <p>
					Rich has been playing in blues, jazz, and rock bands since 1991 and joined Power Up in 2024. A long-time admirer of Mark Evans and Cliff Williams, Rich stays true to their respective bass sounds and playing styles, delivering the relentless groove that is the hallmark of AC/DC. Though the newest member of Power Up, Rich is quickly establishing himself as the 'secret weapon' of the band- with much needed backing vocals and killer bass lines.
